A novel species, Kitasatospora camelliae sp. nov. (strain HUAS MG31T), was isolated from <AUTO:rhizosphere soil of Camellia oleifera>. The strain <AUTO:produces white substrate mycelium and hair brown aerial mycelium> and <AUTO:aerial hyphae form rectiflexible spore chains consisting of spherical or cylindrical spores with smooth surfaces>. The strain shows <AUTO:16S rRNA gene shows 99.5% similarity to K. paranensis> and has a <AUTO:genome G+C content is 73.6%>. The genome <AUTO:genome encodes multiple secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (including type I, II, and III PKS and NRPS)>. It is <AUTO:positive for starch hydrolysis>, <AUTO:negative for gelatin liquefaction>, and <AUTO:negative for Tween (20, 40, 60, 80) decomposition>. The strain is <AUTO:able to utilize d-cellobiose, d-galactose, d-mannose, d-glucose, inositol, and maltose as sole carbon sources> but <AUTO:unable to utilize α-lactose, d-ribose, d-xylose, l-arabinose, l-rhamnose, or sucrose>. The <AUTO:cell wall peptidoglycan contains meso-diaminopimelic acid> and <AUTO:whole-cell sugars are galactose and mannose>. Major fatty acids include <AUTO:major fatty acids include iso-C16:0, iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0, iso-C17:0, anteiso-C17:0, summed feature 9 (iso-C17:1 ω9c/10-methyl C16:0), summed feature 3 (iso H-C16:1/C16:1 ω6c), and cyclo C17:0>. The strain contains <AUTO:polar lipids include diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositolmannosides> and <AUTO:major menaquinones are MK-9(H6), MK-9(H8), and MK-9(H4)>. The organism <AUTO:grows between 10 °C and 40 °C (optimum 28 °C)>, <AUTO:tolerates up to 3% NaCl (optimum 1%)>, and <AUTO:grows at pH 6.0–8.0 (optimum pH 7.0)>. The strain <AUTO:reproduces via formation of aerial mycelia that differentiate into rectiflexible chains of spherical or cylindrical spores> and is <AUTO:naturally found in soil environments, specifically rhizosphere soil associated with Camellia oleifera>.
