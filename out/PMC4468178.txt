S. meliloti AK21, isolated from saline and polluted soils in the Aral Sea Region, forms <AUTO:symbiotic association with Medicago spp. (forms nodules)> and <AUTO:thrives in saline, drought-affected, and polluted soils>. The strain exhibits <AUTO:salt tolerance>, <AUTO:drought tolerance>, and <AUTO:growth at high pH (10) and in 5% KCl>. Key features include <AUTO:broad metabolic adaptation to multiple C, N, P, and S sources (e.g., 2-deoxy-D-ribose, cUMP, l-methionine sulfoxide)> and <AUTO:tolerance to multiple antibiotics, fungicides, and xenobiotics>. It possesses an <AUTO:intact expR allele> and shows <AUTO:production of capsular polysaccharide (ExpR-proficient, mucoid)>. The strain has <AUTO:presence of flagella (though flagellar genes are downregulated compared to Rm1021)> and demonstrates <AUTO:ability to modulate flagellum-based motility>. Metabolically, it performs <AUTO:nitrogen fixation>, <AUTO:trehalose biosynthesis for osmotolerance>, <AUTO:rhizobitoxine biosynthesis>, and uses <AUTO:cbb3-type terminal oxidaseâ€“based respiration> and <AUTO:fixNOQP cbb3-oxidase for microaerobic respiration>. The strain shows <AUTO:ability to alter expression of flagellum/chemotaxis genes, phosphate-uptake genes, and cbb3 oxidase genes in response to environmental conditions> and <AUTO:greater substrate-use versatility under stress>. Genetically, it has <AUTO:possession of an accessory plasmid (repABC replicon family)> with <AUTO:plasmid mobilization genes (traG, VirB9-like)> enabling <AUTO:capacity for conjugative plasmid transfer (traG, VirB9-like system)>. It shows <AUTO:large deletions/variations in pSymA relative to Rm1021> and <AUTO:presence of novel divergent/orphan genes not in Rm1021>. The strain is particularly adapted to <AUTO:saline soils>, <AUTO:drought-affected soils>, and <AUTO:chemically contaminated and polluted soils of the North Aral Sea Region>.
