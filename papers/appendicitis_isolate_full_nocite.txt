Abstract
A clinical isolate, R131, was isolated from the peritoneal swab of a patient who suffered from ruptured appendicitis with
abscess and gangrene in Hong Kong in 2018. Cells are facultatively anaerobic, non-motile,
Gram-positive
coccobacilli.
Colonies were small, grey, semi-translucent,
low convex and alpha-haemolytic.
The bacterium grew on blood agar but
not on Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) and Mueller–Hinton agars. It was negative for catalase, oxidase, indole and aesculin
hydrolysis. The initial identification attempts via matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry
and 16S rRNA gene sequencing yielded inconclusive results. The 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that R131
shared >99% nucleotide identity with certain uncultured Actinomycetales bacteria. In this retrospective investigation,
a complete genome of R131 was constructed, disclosing a DNA G+C content of 64%. Phylogenetic analysis showed
that the bacterium was mostly related to Scrofimicrobium canadense WB03_NA08, which was first described in 2020.
However, its 16S rRNA gene shared only 94.15% nucleotide identity with that of S. canadense WB03_NA08. Notably,
the orthoANI between R131 and S. canadense WB03_NA08 was 67.81%. A pan-genome
analysis encompassing R131
and 4 Scrofimicrobium genomes showed 986 core gene clusters shared with the Scrofimicrobium species, along with
601 cloud genes. The average nucleotide identity comparisons within the pan-genome
analysis ranged from 59.78 to
62.51% between R131 and the other Scrofimicrobium species. Correspondingly, the dDDH values ranged from 19.20 to
22.30%, while the POCP values spanned from 57.48 to 60.94%. Therefore, a novel species, Scrofimicrobium appendicitidis
sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is R131T (=JCM 36615T=LMG 33627T).
Introducti on
Scrofimicrobium is a relatively new genus first proposed by Wylensek et al. in 2020 [1]. According to the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy database, the only one species under this genus is Scrofimicrobium
canadense WB03_NA08, which was isolated from the pig intestine in Canada [1]. In the Genome Taxonomy Database
(GTDB) (https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/), three additional genomes are classified as Scrofimicrobium, including Schaalia
sp. (GCF_014525425.1 and GCF_014069575.1) and Actinomyces minihominis (GCF_900187855.1). Scrofimicrobium
belongs to the family Actinomycetaceae, which are facultative anaerobic Gram-positive
rods. In this study, we described
the isolation and characterization of a novel species in Scrofimicrobium, initially isolated from a patient with ruptured
appendicitis in Hong Kong.

A 60-year-
old
Chinese man was admitted to the hospital in September 2018 because of right lower quadrant abdominal pain
for 3 days and fever for 1 day. A contrast computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed acute appendicitis with
peri-appendiceal
abscess formation. Laparoscopic appendicectomy with drainage of the appendiceal abscess was performed. The
peritoneal swab was obtained, which later grew Escherichia coli, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and an unknown Gram-positive
coccobacillus (bacterium R131). The patient was treated with intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate
and was later switched to
intravenous ertapenem. He eventually recovered and was discharged after 15 days of hospitalization.
The bacterium, R131, appeared as non-motile
Gram-positive
coccobacilli under a microscope. It grew on horse blood agar as
small, grey, semi-translucent,
alpha-haemolytic
colonies of 0.5–1.0 mm in diameter after 48 h incubation at 37 °C in ambient air.
It also grew in an anaerobic environment. Matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-
TOF
MS) was used to identify the bacterium, but no reliable identification was obtained. Subsequent Nanopore 16S rRNA gene
sequencing also failed to yield a conclusive identification until the discovery of S. canadense WB03_NA08. In this retrospective
study, whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) was performed to construct a complete genome of the bacterium. Phylogenetic analysis
and pan-genome
analysis showed that R131 was a novel species closely related to S. canadense.
Methods
Sample collection and extraction
The clinical isolate, R131, was obtained from the microbiology laboratory of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital. Upon
receipt, DNA extraction was performed using QIAamp BiOstic Bacteremia DNA Kit.
Phenotypic characteristics and biochemical properties
Gram stain was performed to examine the composition of the cell wall and the shape of bacterial cells. Transmission electron
microscopy was performed to examine the bacterial cell using ThermoFisher Talos L120C Transmission Electron Microscope.
MALDI-TOF
MS-based
identification was performed using Bruker IVD MALDI Biotyper. The biochemical properties of the
R131 were determined using bioMérieux VITEK® 2 Systems coupled with VITEK® 2 Anaerobic and Corynebacteria identification
card. Catalase and oxidase tests were also performed manually.
Antimicrobial susceptibility test
The clinical isolate R131 was resuspended in saline with a concentration of 0.5 McFarland. The bacterial suspension was streaked
evenly on blood Mueller–Hinton agars, and a maximum of six antibiotic discs were placed on the surface of an agar. A total of 14
Gram-positive
spectrum antibiotics were tested, including ampicillin 10 μg (AMP 10), ceftriaxone 30 μg (CRO 30), tetracycline
30 μg (TE 30), vancomycin 30 μg (VA 30), gentamicin 10 μg (CN 10), meropenem 10 μg (MEM 10), cefoxitin 30 μg (FOX 30),
chloramphenicol 30 μg (C 30), erythromycin 15 μg (E 15), co-trimoxazole
25 μg (SXT 25), ciprofloxacin 5 μg (CIP 5), ceftazidime
30 μg (CAZ 30), cefepime 30 μg (FEP 30) and clindamycin 2 μg (DA 2). The agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h aerobically
with 5% CO2. The zone sizes were measured for the determination of antimicrobial susceptibility.
Whole-genome sequencing
Both Nanopore sequencing and Illumina sequencing were used for WGS of R131. For Nanopore sequencing, library preparation
was performed using the transpose-based
rapid barcoding kit (SQK-RBK110.96)
from Oxford Nanopore Technologies according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. After pooling and adapter ligation, the library was loaded on the flow cell FLO-MIN106
R9.4.1
and sequenced using the GridION device for 48 h in high-accuracy
base calling mode.
The high-accuracy
Illumina sequencing was performed to further polish the nanopore reads. Library preparation was performed
using NEBNext® Ultra™ II FS DNA Library Prep Kit coupled with NEBNext® Multiplex Oligos for Illumina® (96 Unique Dual
Index Primer Pairs). The fragment size of the libraries was examined using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument coupled with
Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit. The libraries were quantified using Roche LightCycler® 480 System coupled with QIAseq Library
Quant Assay Kit. After normalization, the pooled library was sequenced on Illumina Miseq system with MiSeq Reagent Kit V2.
Genome assembly and taxonomic assignment
Both the Illumina sequences and the nanopore sequences were used for genome assembly. Before assembly, quality-control
filtering using fastp [2] v0.22.0 for Illumina short reads and using Filtlong [3] v0.2.1 (with a minimum read length of 1 kbp and
a kept-base
percentage of 95%) for nanopore long reads were conducted. Then, a long-read-
first
approach using Trycycler v0.5.0
[4] was taken to assemble the genome. First, the long reads were divided into 12 subsets and assembled using Flye [5], minasm
[6] + minipolish [7] and raven [8], making 12 different genome assemblies, with 1 assembly program assembling 4 sets of reads.
Then, the 12 assemblies were merged into a single consensus assembly using Trycycler, and the single assembly was polished
by Medaka v1.4.4 [9]. The polished long-read
assembly was finally polished by short reads using Polypolish [10] followed by
3
Lao et al., Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2025;75:006633
POLCA [11]. To avoid missing the small plasmids that may be underrepresented in the long-read
sets, a short-read-
first
hybrid
genome assembly was made using Unicycler v0.5.0 [12]. The quality and completeness of the genome assembly were evaluated
using BUSCO v5.2.2 (bacteria_odb10) [13].
The taxonomy of R131 was assigned based on the 16S rRNA genes, the 23S rRNA genes and the marker genes across the whole
genome. With full sequences of 16S rRNA genes and 23S rRNA genes predicted from the genome assembly, the taxonomy identity
was assigned using silva ACT: Alignment, Classification and Tree Service (with sina 1.2.12 [14] and silva SSU and LSU databases
138.1 [15], default parameters). With the whole genome, the App ‘Classify Microbes with GTDB-Tk
- v1.7.0’ [16] in KBase [17]
was used for marker genes identification and taxonomic assignment. The degree of genomic similarity of the unknown bacterium
with related species (species in the same genus, according to GTDB R08-RS214)
was estimated using the Orthologous Average
Nucleotide Identity Tool [18].
Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene
The full sequence of 16S rRNA predicted from the genome assembly of R131 was used for the analysis. The 16S rRNA gene
sequence of Scrofimicrobium was downloaded from the NCBI server, and the aligned 16S rRNA gene sequences of a type strain
from each of the other species in the family Actinomycetaceae and the outgroup Escherichia coli were downloaded from the silva
RefNR SSU r138.1 database [15]. The 16S rRNA sequences of the unknown bacterium and Scrofimicrobium were aligned against
the aligned sequences from the silva database using sina v1.7.2 [14]. RAxML v8.2.12 (with GTRGAMMA substitution model
and a bootstrap of 800 replicates under the AutoMRE option) [19] was used to construct the phylogenetic tree. The resulting
phylogenetic tree was visualized and annotated using the Interactive Tree of Life software (iTOL v6) [20].
Phylogenomic analysis
The phylogenomic tree was inferred using the command ‘de_novo_wf ’ of the Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit (GTDB-Tk)
v2.3.0 [21] based on the GTDB release 08-RS214.0
[22] (with ‘f__Actinomycetaceae’ as the taxa_filter and ‘s__Escherichia coli’
as the outgroup_taxon). The resulting phylogenomic tree was visualized and annotated using the iTOL v6 [20].
Genome annotation and antimicrobial resistance prediction
Based on the classification that R131 was in the genus Scrofimicrobium, the genome was annotated using RASTtk [23] on the
Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) server [24] and the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline
(PGAP) build6771 [25]. The protein sequences encoded by the potential genes predicted from PGAP were further analysed by
BlastKOALA [26] for functional annotation based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology. The
genome map was visualized using Proksee [27]. Antimicrobial resistance was predicted using ResFinder [28], ResFinderFG 2.0
[29] and AMRFinderPlus v3.11.26 [30, 31].
Pan-genome analysis
A total of four genomes were classified to the genus Scrofimicrobium based on GTDB, and their respective genomes were downloaded
from NCBI. The genomes were annotated using PGAP [25]. Pan-genome
analysis among the four genomes and R131 was
conducted using get_homologues [32]. Clustering of orthologues genes was performed based on the OrthoMCL algorithm using
the get_ homologues. pl script, the average nucleotide identity (ANI) of the clustered sequences was also determined. Pan-genome
matrix was calculated using the compare_ clusters. pl script. The number of core genes, soft-core
genes, shell genes and cloud
genes was estimated using the parse_ pangenome_ matrix. pl script. A pangenome tree was illustrated using IQ-TREE
2 [33] and
visualized using FigTree (v1.4.4). Core genes were annotated using BlastKOALA [26] with ‘Prokaryotes’ database.
Digital DNA–DNA hybridization analysis
Genome similarity between R131 and the four Scrofimicrobium genomes was also evaluated using digital DNA–DNA hybridization
(dDDH) values. The nucleotide sequences of the five genomes were submitted to Genome-to-
Genome
Distance Calculator
(GGDC 3.0) (http://ggdc.dsmz.de/ggdc.php) [34] for analysis. While a dDDH value of 70% defines species boundaries, a value
of 79% delimits subspecies [35].
Percentage of conserved protein analysis
Percentage of conserved protein (POCP) analysis was performed to estimate the genome similarity between two microbial
genomes based on the proportion of shared proteins. A threshold of 50% indicates that two strains belong to the same genus [36].
POCP values among R131, the four Scrofimicrobium genomes based on GTDB and the type species of Actinomyces (Actinomyces
bovis NCTC 11535) and Schaalia (Schaalia odontolytica NCTC9935) were calculated using POCP-nf
(https://github.com/hoelzer/
pocp) [37]. Briefly, protein annotation was conducted using Prokka [38], followed by an ‘all-vs-
all’
comparison of proteins using
blastp [39].

Results
Phenotypic characteristics, biochemical properties and antimicrobial susceptibility profile
R131 was non-motile
Gram-positive
coccobacilli. The bacterium was facultative anaerobe, which can be grown on blood
agar anaerobically or aerobically (with or without 5% CO2) at 37 °C. Small (0.5–1.0 mm), grey, semi-translucent
and alpha-haemolytic
colonies were observed on the blood agar after 48-h
incubation (Table S1, available in the online Supplementary
Material). The cell size of the strain was about 0.5–0.6 μm wide and 0.7–1.0 μm long (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1. Transmission electron graph of R131.
The biochemical properties of the R131 are summarized in Table 1. The bacterium can utilize d-cellobiose,
d-galactose,
d-glucose,
d-mannose,
d-ribose,
l-arabinose,
d-xylose
and maltotriose as sole carbon source. However, unlike its closely
related species, Scrofimicrobium canadense WB03_NA08, it cannot utilize d-maltose.
It also cannot utilize sucrose. The
bacterium does not produce the enzymes catalase, oxidase, and phosphatase. Nevertheless, it produces urease, cholinesterase
and phenylphosphonate hydrolase, distinguishing it from the urease-negative
S. canadense WB03_NA08. It also possesses
several glycosidases, including beta-glucuronidase,
alpha-arabinosidase,
alpha-l-
fucosidase,
beta-d-
fucosidase
and beta-galactosidase.
Additionally, it harbours several arylamidases, including Ala-Phe-
Pro-
arylamidase,
leucine arylamidase,
l-proline
arylamidase, phenylalanine arylamidase and tyrosine arylamidase. The bacterium is incapable of hydrolysing
aesculin, arginine and tryptophan.
The susceptibility of R131 to 14 Gram-positive
spectrum antibiotics was tested using the disc diffusion method. R131 was
susceptible to all 14 antibiotics, including ampicillin (AMP 10), ceftriaxone (CRO 30), tetracycline (TE 30), vancomycin
(VA 30), gentamicin (CN 10), meropenem (MEM 10), cefoxitin (FOX 30), chloramphenicol (C 30), erythromycin (E 15),
co-trimoxazole
(SXT 25), ciprofloxacin (CIP 5), ceftazidime (CAZ 30), cefepime (FEP 30) and clindamycin (DA 2) (Table 2).
The quality of the assembly and the genome characteristics
A complete circular chromosome of size around 2.22 Mbps was assembled (CP138335). The Unicycler hybrid assembly did
not recover any small plasmid. The BUSCO analysis shows that the genome assembly contains 122 complete and single-copy
BUSCOs (98.4%) and two fragmented BUSCOs (1.6%), indicating a high level of completeness of the assembly. The G+C
content of the genome is 64%. Annotation using RASTtk identifies a total of 2054 features, including 2001 coding sequences
and 53 RNAs. Twenty-eight
per cent of the genes were assigned to subsystems by RASTtk. Nineteen genes were assigned to
the subsystem ‘Virulence, Disease and Defense’, with ten genes involved in the resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds
and nine genes involved in the invasion and intracellular resistance. Annotation using PGAP identifies a total of 2027 genes/
pseudogenes, including 1970 CDSs and 57 RNAs. Among the 1957 protein sequences encoded by the non-pseudo
protein-coding
genes analysed by BlastKOALA, 60.3% were annotated. The KEGG Mapper Reconstruction results from BlastKOALA

include 198 pathways, 36 BRITE categories and 33 complete modules. The genetic map of the circular chromosome of
R131, based on the annotation of PGAP, with the labelling of selected features from RAST and BlastKOALA annotations,
is depicted in Fig. 2. Despite there are genes predicted to be involved in the resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds
by RAST and genes assigned to the KEGG pathways and Brite categories of antimicrobial resistance, there is no complete
KEGG module for antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, the analyses using ResFinder, ResFinderFG 2.0 and AMRFinderPlus
predicted no antimicrobial resistance in R131. It is concluded that R131 is susceptible to most of the common antibiotics
based on bioinformatics prediction. This is consistent with the results of the antimicrobial susceptibility test.
Phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses
The bacterium, R131, remained ‘unclassified’ when being classified using 23S rRNA gene sequence against the silva LSU
database and classified as belonging to the genus Actinomyces using 16S rRNA gene sequence (OR652275) against the silva
SSU database. Using GTDB-Tk
in KBase, R131 was assigned as a member of the genus Actinomyces_I in GTDB release 202
(this genus was later updated to ‘Scrofimicrobium’ in GTDB release 207). Despite these taxonomic assignments from silva
ACT and GTDB-Tk,
the specific species of R131 could not be determined.
Given that both tools recognized R131 as part of the Actinomycetaceae family, the phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses
focused on comparing R131 with other Actinomycetaceae members. The bacterium was grouped with S. canadense WB03_
NA08 in the 16S rRNA gene tree (Fig. 3). Currently, the widely accepted thresholds for taxonomic classification based on
16S rRNA gene sequence similarity are set at 98.7% for species, 94.5% for genera and 86.5% for families [40]. Notably, the
16S rRNA gene sequences of R131 and S. canadense WB03_NA08 shared 94.15% nucleotide identity, bordering on the lower
limit of the genus differentiation threshold.
In the phylogenomic study, R131 was also clustered with the members in the genus of Scrofimicrobium (Fig. 4). The OrthoANI
values between the genome of R131 and those of other Scrofimicrobium members range from 67.1 to 69.1%, falling below

the 95% threshold for species delineation [40]. However, there is no standard ANI threshold for genus delimitation [36].
These findings collectively indicate that R131 represents a novel species, which closely related to the genus Scrofimicrobium.
Pan-genome analysis
Four genomes, which were Actinomyces (Scrofimicrobium) minihominis Marseille-P3850
(GCF_900187855.1), Schaalia
(Scrofimicrobium) sp. JY-X159
(GCF_014525425.1), Schaalia (Scrofimicrobium) sp. JY-X169
(GCF_014069575.1) and
S. canadense WB03_NA08 (GCF_009696615.1), were analysed with R131 for pan-genome
analysis. A total of 3994 gene
clusters were identified, and the 5 genomes shared 986 core gene clusters (Table 3). A representative sequence in R131 from
each of the core gene clusters was annotated using BlastKOALA, and the result was summarized in Table S2. The cloud
genes, which are the genes present in two or less of the genomes, ranged from 361 to 1105 genes. The ANI values of clustered
sequences (Table 4) and the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S1) showed that R131 was distant from the other four genomes, proving
that it is a novel species in the genus Scrofimicrobium.
dDDH analysis
The dDDH values for R131 and four Scrofimicrobium genomes are summarized in Table 5. When compared with the four genomes,
R131 exhibited a dDDH value below 70%, indicating that R131 represents a distinct species from S. canadense WB03_NA08,
S. minihominis Marseille-P3850,
Scrofimicrobium sp. JY-X159
and Scrofimicrobium sp. JY-X169.
Additionally, the dDDH value
of 84.1% between Scrofimicrobium sp. JY-X159
and Scrofimicrobium sp. JY-X169
indicated that they belong to the same species.
POCP analysis
Given that ANI and dDDH values are typically utilized for species delineation without providing clear indications for
genus delimitation, a POCP analysis was conducted to ascertain the genus affiliation of the five genomes. Notably, discrepancies
in genus assignments between NCBI and GTDB for Actinomyces (Scrofimicrobium) minihominis Marseille-P3850,
Schaalia (Scrofimicrobium) sp. JY-X159
and Schaalia (Scrofimicrobium) sp. JY-X169
prompted the inclusion of the type
species of Actinomyces and Schaalia, namely A. bovis NCTC 11535 (GCF_900444995.1) and S. odontolytica NCTC9935
(GCF_900445025.1), respectively, in the POCP analysis.

The outcomes of the POCP analysis, detailed in Table 6, revealed that R131 exhibited a POCP value exceeding 50% when
compared against the four Scrofimicrobium genomes, signifying their shared genus classification. In contrast, the POCP
value between A. bovis NCTC 11535 and Actinomyces (Scrofimicrobium) minihominis Marseille-P3850,

and JY-X169),
fell below the
50% threshold. Considering the results of phylogenomic study (Fig. 4) and the POCP analysis, it is proposed to reclassify
Fig. 4. Phylogenomic tree of the family Actinomycetaceae based on the 120 phylogenetically informative markers protein of bacteria (bac120) in GTDB.
The tree was inferred by the approximately maximum likelihood method using FastTree embedded GTDBTk. The numbers on branches denote the SH-like
supports ≥0.5. The colour ranges represent the genera in the family Actinomycetaceae according to the GTDB R08-RS214.0.
Escherichia coli was
used as the outgroup. Accession numbers of the genomes used and the species names are given in the leaf labels. The leaf label of R131 and branches
of the clade of its predicted genus are shown in red.

Description of Scrofimicrobium appendicitidis sp. nov.
Scrofimicrobium appendicitidis ( ap. pen. di. ci' ti. dis. N.L. gen. n. appendicitidis, of appendicitis). The closest phylogenetic
neighbour is S. canadense WB03_NA08, which shares 94.15% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity. OrthoANI, dDDH and
POCP values against the genome of S. canadense WB03_NA08 are 67.81, 22.20 and 57.48%, respectively. Cells are facultatively
anaerobic, non-motile,
Gram-positive
coccobacilli (~0.5–0.6 μm wide and 0.7–1.0 μm long). Cells grow on blood
agar at 37 °C in ambient air after 48-h
incubation, with or without 5% CO2. Cells also grow on anaerobic blood agar under
anaerobic environments. Requires blood to grow, unable to grow on Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar and Mueller–Hinton
agar. Colonies are small (0.5–1.0 mm), grey, semi-translucent,
low convex and alpha-haemolytic.
